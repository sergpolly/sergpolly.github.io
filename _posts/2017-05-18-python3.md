# python3 default

Before:

```bash
python -> ../Cellar/python/2.7.11/bin/python
python2 -> ../Cellar/python/2.7.11/bin/python2
python3 -> ../Cellar/python3/3.6.1/bin/python3
```

After applying ```ln -sf ../Cellar/python3/3.6.1/bin/python3 python```

```bash
python -> ../Cellar/python3/3.6.1/bin/python3
python2 -> ../Cellar/python/2.7.11/bin/python2
python3 -> ../Cellar/python3/3.6.1/bin/python3
```

Even ipython, somehow launches with python3 engine now.
