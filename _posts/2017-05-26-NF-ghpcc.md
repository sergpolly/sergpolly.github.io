# GHPCC Nextflow


Note: Java-related installations should be done in an interactive mode on the cluster. Request interactive job as ```bsub -q interactive -Is bash```.


We'd need to install nextflow in a java environment:
```
module load java/1.7.0_25
curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash
./nextflow -version
```
