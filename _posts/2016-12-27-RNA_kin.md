RNA folding kinetics can be approached using a bunch of programs from the [ViennaRNA][ViennaRNA].
Instead of doing stochastic modeling with something like Kinfold, one can use RNA folding spectrum information obtained by means of [RNAsubopt][RNAsubopt] for example:

{% highlight bash %}
echo CGUUUUGAUGACCAGGACAAUAUA | RNAsubopt -e 6.0 -s > spectrum.dat
{% endhighlight %}

Energies of the suboptimal structures are within the range of `6.0` from the MFE, as specified by `-e 6.0` option.
Once spectrum is calculated and stored, we can get to the barrier construction phase:

{% highlight bash %}
cat spectrum.dat | barriers --rates --saddle --bsize > foo.bar
{% endhighlight %}

`--rates` is the single most important option here, as it makes `barriers` generate `rates.out` file which contains rates of transition between the suboptimal structures as calculated using some internal math. `barriers` accept sorted spectrum files only, that is why we used `-s` option while doing `RNAsubopt`. Once we have the rates, we can model the folding kinetics of the `CGUUUUGAUGACCAGGACAAUAUA` molecule using information just about a handful of its suboptimal structures.

{% highlight bash %}
treekin -m I --p0 2=1.0 < rates.out > treekin_out.dat
{% endhighlight %}

`-m I` is the default option anyways, implying that the transition rates are read from input rather that using Arrhenius ones. And the next option `--p0 2=1.0` specifies initial condition of the "system" (an ensemble of `CGUUUUGAUGACCAGGACAAUAUA` molecules in solution at `time=0.0`): in this case `100%` molecules are in the unfolded state which happens to have label `2` in the `barriers` output.

Once kinetics is modeled, we can do some plotting.

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

dat = pd.read_csv('treekin_out.dat',delim_whitespace=True,comment='#',header=None)
dat = dat.rename(columns={0:'time'})

plt.clf()
for i in dat.columns[1:]:
	plt.plot(dat['time'],dat[i],label=str(i))

ax = plt.gca()
ax.set_xscale('log')
ax.set_xlabel('time')
ax.set_ylabel('structure probability')
plt.legend()

plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}




Beware, that there are some divergences in the ways I was using these programs with [ViennaRNA tutorial][ViennaTutorial] hidden on their web site.
